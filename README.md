# ContactsApp-Android
A contacts app created using android studio as a final project
All the Java classes that i have created can be easily found by following this path: 
C:\Users\MBM\Desktop\SIT207_Android_Programming\ContactsApp\app\src\main\java\com\example\mbm\contactsapp

The menu layout xml file which displays the about page and settings page can be found here:
C:\Users\MBM\Desktop\SIT207_Android_Programming\ContactsApp\app\src\main\res\menu

All other layouts created can be found through this path:
C:\Users\MBM\Desktop\SIT207_Android_Programming\ContactsApp\app\src\main\res\layout

There were some errors when i tried to use views in xml layout fil. For some reason i wasn't able to see the views i added to the file. A solution I found online was to change the version of the gradle (module) app from 28 to 27. This solution worked for me.
